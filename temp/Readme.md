# Bismuth Mining Evolution

On October 8, 2018 a new and novel mining algorithm was introduced on the Bismuth network.

Before the new mining algorithm was introduced the distribution of the hashrate among the pools was as shown below:

It is believed that a large portion of the hashrate by Pool 4 was contributed by an FPGA miner.

A few days after the new mining algorithm was introduced the distribution of the hashrate among the pools was as shown below:
